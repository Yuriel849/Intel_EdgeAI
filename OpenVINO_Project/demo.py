description = """
Bark is a universal text-to-audio model created by [Suno](http://suno.ai). \
Bark can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio - including music, background noise and simple sound effects. \
The model output is not censored and the authors do not endorse the opinions in the generated content. \
Use at your own risk.

## üåé Foreign Language

Bark supports various languages out-of-the-box and automatically determines language from input text. \
When prompted with code-switched text, Bark will even attempt to employ the native accent for the respective languages in the same voice.

Try the prompt:

```
Buenos d√≠as Miguel. Tu colega piensa que tu alem√°n es extremadamente malo. But I suppose your english isn't terrible.
```

## ü§≠ Non-Speech Sounds

Below is a list of some known non-speech sounds, but we are finding more every day. \
Please let us know if you find patterns that work particularly well on Discord!

* [laughter]
* [laughs]
* [sighs]
* [music]
* [gasps]
* [clears throat]
* ‚Äî or ... for hesitations
* ‚ô™ for song lyrics
* capitalization for emphasis of a word
* MAN/WOMAN: for bias towards speaker

Try the prompt:

```
" [clears throat] Hello, my name is Suno. And, uh ‚Äî and I like pizza. [laughs] But I also have other interests such as... ‚ô™ singing ‚ô™."
```

## üé∂ Music
Bark can generate all types of audio, and, in principle, doesn't see a difference between speech and music. \
Sometimes Bark chooses to generate text as music, but you can help it out by adding music notes around your lyrics.

Try the prompt:

```
‚ô™ In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion barks tonight ‚ô™
```

## üß¨ Voice Cloning

Bark has the capability to fully clone voices - including tone, pitch, emotion and prosody. \
The model also attempts to preserve music, ambient noise, etc. from input audio. \
However, to mitigate misuse of this technology, we limit the audio history prompts to a limited set of Suno-provided, fully synthetic options to choose from.

## üë• Speaker Prompts

You can provide certain speaker prompts such as NARRATOR, MAN, WOMAN, etc. \
Please note that these are not always respected, especially if a conflicting audio history prompt is given.

Try the prompt:

```
WOMAN: I would like an oatmilk latte please.
MAN: Wow, that's expensive!
```
